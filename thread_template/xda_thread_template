        YOU are doing modifications to your device.
        YOU are responsible for what you do.
        We are not responsible for any damages, data loss or any type of unexpected,
        bad or damaging results! If you have **SERIOUS** problems with this software,
        please contact the developers or maintainers. We are not liable for anything
        bad that happens to your device.
        As long as you are responsible, some companies such as OnePlus
        WILL HONOR IT. Some people occasionally describe them as heroes.
        Don't be stupid and bet on that though, please be responsible for what you do.
        We prohibit you from overclocking to 1337 GHz thinking, that an OEM would

        We recommend you to take the advice above regardless.

[B][U][SIZE="4"]halogen[color="#1e88e5"]OS[/color] Checklist[/SIZE][/U][/B]
[B]
Although no data should be lost or damaged by the flashing process, 
we advise you to follow the following steps if you are coming from another rom:
[/B]

[list]
 [*] Please take a full nandroid backup!
 [*] Please copy your back up to an external device.
 [*] Backing up your Internal Storage is also recommended.
 [*] When completed, please clean flash the build!
[/list]

Although you usually can dirty flash halogenOS over other ROMs, considering the other
ROM has the [b]same[/b] Android version, it is not guaranteed. In case of serious
crashes please do a clean flash.

You [b]can[/b] dirty flash halogenOS 7 (Nougat) over halogenOS 6 (Marshmallow)
without any problems. Although we can't promise that it [b]will[/b] work for you,
we can tell you that this has been tested. In fact, @xdvs23 did a dirty flash of
XOS 7 over XOS 6 and has no problems.

If you get app crashes after dirty flashing over XOS 6 or another ROM, please just
clear the app data of those apps, and it should work fine then.

        [SIZE="3"][B][color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color] is a new generation cutting-edge OS for Android based on Code Aurora Forum releases.[/B]

        [B][SIZE="4"][U]What is [color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color]?[/U][/SIZE][/B]
        halogen[color="#1e88e5"]OS[/color], also known as [color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color] is a new Android ROM which ships with the global aim to
        become a modular ROM which keeps as high as potentially possible operating
        performance on your mobile device while still maintaining a sufficient feature
        base of nice, small and minimal features that would not be available via any
        external feature base, extension, mod or plugin.

        We hope you have a truly halogenified experience!

        [B][SIZE="4"][U]Internals of [color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color][/U][/SIZE][/B]
        At core, the ROM is composed mainly of components from CodeAuroraForums (CAF),
        featuring only extremely minor set of components from CyanogenMod (CM) which
        have been added to source in order to allow for better cross-device compatibility.

        [B][SIZE="4"][U]Our [color="#1e88e5"]LOVE[/color] to others[/U][/SIZE][/B]
        A huge thanks goes to those behind the CodeAuroraForums (CAF), the CyanogenMod
        organization and all of its
        contributors for the sources used in the development of the base ROM which we
        started with inclusive of all the work and dedication their team puts in order to
        keep us updated on the awesome contributions that they make.

        We will be keen on ensuring that we be up to date with the code from our base sources,
        with regular ROM updates hopefully coming from time to time.

        Please do not ask for ETA's (else you shall be spooked by Mr Skeltal). Almost all of us are
        students, and with the current lifestyles and routines we have, it is not that easy to acquire
        time to develop the ROM, though we'll be sure to keep you updated and release OTAs as
        soon as they are available and ready for publication. If you want to be really updated quick,
        then join us on Telegram: [url]http://telegram.me/halogenos[/url]

        Visit our website for features such as: Downloads, Information etc.

[b][SIZE="5"]Common stuff[/SIZE][/b]

The ROM is super stable as of now and we'll maintain a clean and proper ROM.

Known issues are going to be fixed as soon as possible. We don't have infinite time.

[b]Planned features (don't ask for these!): [/b]
[list]
  [*] Heads-Up toggle
  [*] Button actions
  [*] OTA Updates
[/list]

[b]Highlights (some are OP2-only): [/b]
[list]
  [*] No QS Bug!!!
  [*] OnePlus Camera
  [*] Working Vulkan
  [*] Reworked Lockscreen Visualizer
  [*] New implementation of button backlight
  [*] Modern Services -> Google Assistant etc.
  [*] Substratum
  [*] Full media support (FFMPEG, video codecs, ...)
  [*] Great Audio quality, no distortions, no crap
  [*] Optimized many portions of the system including surfaceflinger, inputflinger, System Server, and more
  [*] Super fast boot
  [*] Superuser-capable
  [*] Great battery life
  [*] Soundmod support (not all soundmods work on Nougat, it's not our fault)
  [*] addon.d support (backups your gapps etc. when flashing new build - don't wipe system before flashing!)
  [*] init.d support
  [*] BusyBox
  [*] Disabled Access Time for all partitions (We don't need access time. When access time is enabled, it will store the exact date of the access when a file is accessed, what just wastes write cycles (in theory) and has impact in I/O performance.)

  [*] Support for trusted third-party WebViews like Chrome
  [*] Long press on home for assist toggle
  [*] Security Patches in kernel
  [*] KCal support

  [*] Offline Gestures support (super fast recoginition)
  [*] Alert Slider
  [*] Full KeyHandler & KeyDisabler support
  [*] Dexpreopt for faster (first) boot time and less space consumption on data partition
  [*] Upgrade & Boot the ROM in just 5 minutes - no more endless waiting for flashing a new build
  [*] Very high compatibility with other ROMs

        We are going to use a custom theme as soon as that theme is working perfectly fine.
