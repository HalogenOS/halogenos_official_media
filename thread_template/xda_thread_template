        [SIZE="3"][B][color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color] is a new generation Android-based cutting-edge OS based on the Android Open Source Project and Code Aurora Forum releases.[/B]

        [B][SIZE="4"][U]What is [color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color]?[/U][/SIZE][/B]
        halogen[color="#1e88e5"]OS[/color], also known as [color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color] is a new Android ROM which ships with the global aim to
        become a modular ROM which keeps as high as potentially possible operating
        performance on your mobile device while still maintaining a sufficient feature
        base of nice, small and minimal features that would not be available via any
        external feature base, extension, mod or plugin.

        We hope you have a truly halogenified experience!

        [B][SIZE="4"][U]Internals of [color="#1e88e5"]XOS[/color][/U][/SIZE][/B]
        At core, the ROM is composed mainly of components from the
        Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and Code Aurora Forum (CAF),
        with extremely minor set of components from LineageOS (LaOS or LN) which
        have been added to source in order to allow for better cross-device compatibility.

        [B][SIZE="4"][U]Our [color="#1e88e5"]LOVE[/color] to others[/U][/SIZE][/B]
        A huge thanks goes to those behind the AOSP and CAF, the LineageOS Project and all of its
        contributors for the sources used in the development of the base ROM which we
        started with inclusive of all the work and dedication their team puts in order to
        keep us updated on the awesome contributions that they make.

        We will be keen on ensuring that we be up to date with the code from our base sources,
        with regular ROM updates hopefully coming from time to time.

        Please do not ask for ETA's (else you shall be spooked by Mr Skeltal). Almost all of us are
        students, and with the current lifestyles and routines we have, it is not that easy to acquire
        time to develop the ROM, though we'll be sure to keep you updated and release OTAs as
        soon as they are available and ready for publication. If you want to be really updated quick,
        then join us on Telegram: [url]http://telegram.me/halogenos[/url]

        Visit our website for features such as: Downloads, Information etc.

Although no data should be lost or damaged by the flashing process,
we advise you to follow the following steps if you are coming from another ROM:
[/B][code]
 * Please take a full [I]Nandroid[/I] backup!
 * Please copy your back up to an external device.
 * Backing up your [I]Internal Storage[/I] is also recommended.
 * When completed, [I]clean flash[/I] the build!
[/code]

Although you usually may dirty flash halogenOS over other ROMs, considering the other
ROM is built upon the [b]same[/b] Android version, it is not guaranteed.
In case of performance issues or crashes please do a clean flash.

You [b]can[/b] dirty flash halogenOS 7 (Nougat) over halogenOS 6 (Marshmallow)
without any problems. Although we cannot promise that it [b]will[/b] work for you,
although we don't recommend it, we can tell you that this has been tested. [/SIZE]

Overall as a ROM, XOS is very stable. Our mission statement has always been of maintaining a clean and properly maintained ROM.
We take proper priority with ensuring that performance and stability are put first, features are considered an extra topping on the cake.
